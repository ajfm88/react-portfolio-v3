# Portfolio API — Shared Express Backend

The Node/Express service that powers the dynamic, authenticated parts of my portfolio: the **`/blog`** (posts + comments) and **`/chat`** (real-time messaging) features. Everything else on the site is a static 3D React front end; this server is where identity, persistence, and real-time live.

> **Status:** Backend complete and deployed — both features. Slices 1–2 landed the server skeleton, database + socket wiring, Clerk authentication, and the Clerk→Mongo user-sync webhook. Slice 3 added the **blog posts API** (`/api/posts`) with public reads, admin-gated writes, and visit-counter-backed Popular/Trending sorts. Slice 4 added the **blog comments API** (`/api/comments`) and closed the loop on orphaned data with cascade deletes. Slice 5 wired up **ImageKit** (`GET /api/posts/upload-auth`) for client-side cover-image uploads. Slice 6 deployed the service to Render, live at `https://3dfolio-ajfm88-server.onrender.com`, with the Clerk webhook registered against the deployed URL and an external keep-alive ping holding the free-tier instance warm. Chat Phase A then added the **messages API** (`/api/messages`) — contacts, conversations, message history, and server-side media upload — plus the **Socket.io real-time layer** (presence + instant delivery) riding the same `http.Server`. Both the `src/blog/` and `src/chat/` frontends (lazy `/blog` and `/chat` in the portfolio) are complete and run against this live API — every endpoint below has a consumer.

## The one-line pitch

> I built one Express API that serves two different product features (a blog and a chat app) off a **single auth system, single database, and single deployment** — instead of standing up two backends. The interesting engineering is in the decisions that made that consolidation clean: where identity lives, how third-party auth stays in sync with my own data, and how I layered real-time on top of plain HTTP.

---

## Why this exists (the architectural decision that matters most)

My blog and chat features were originally two separate projects, each with its own backend, its own user table, and its own auth. Running both would have meant **two servers, two databases, two user records for the same human, and two deploys** to keep alive on a hobby budget.

I made a deliberate call to **merge them into one shared backend**:

- **One Clerk application** is the source of truth for identity across both features.
- **One MongoDB database** holds a single `users` collection that both features reference, alongside blog `posts`/`comments` and chat `messages`.
- **One Express process** (wrapped in an `http.Server` so Socket.io can ride along) serves the REST API for the blog and the WebSocket layer for chat.
- **One deployment** on Render.

The cost of that decision was reconciling two different data models and two different auth conventions into one. That reconciliation is most of what the "why" below is about.

> **I also moved this off Firebase on purpose.** The rest of my site uses Firebase (Firestore/Storage/Auth) for simple, single-author admin content. But the blog + chat need relational-style references between users, posts, comments, and messages, plus a real WebSocket server for presence and message delivery. A self-hosted Express + MongoDB + Socket.io stack models that far more naturally than Firestore's document model and gives me full control over the request lifecycle — so I chose the right tool for _this_ job rather than forcing everything into one platform.

## Tech stack & why each piece

| Concern        | Choice                                         | Why                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTTP framework | **Express 5**                                  | Minimal, well-understood, huge ecosystem. Express 5's native `async` error propagation keeps controllers clean.                                                 |
| Database       | **MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose**                   | Document model fits blog posts and chat messages naturally; Mongoose gives me schema validation and a typed-ish model layer over a schemaless store.            |
| Authentication | **Clerk** (`@clerk/express`)                   | Offloads the genuinely hard, high-risk parts of auth — password storage, sessions, OAuth, MFA — to a specialist. I own my app logic, not a credential database. |
| Real-time      | **Socket.io**                                  | Presence (who's online) and instant message delivery for chat, with automatic reconnection and a room/broadcast model.                                          |
| Media uploads  | **ImageKit** (`@imagekit/nodejs`) + **Multer** | Off-loads image storage, CDN delivery, and on-the-fly transforms. Blog cover images upload client-side straight to ImageKit (slice 5); chat media uploads server-side through **Multer** (in-memory, 25 MB cap, image/video-only filter) into the same ImageKit account, since a chat message needs the URL persisted before it can be emitted over the socket. |
| Config         | **dotenv**                                     | Twelve-factor style — every secret and environment difference comes from the environment, nothing is hardcoded.                                                 |
| Dev loop       | **nodemon**                                    | Auto-restart on save.                                                                                                                                           |

## How a request flows through the server

The order of middleware in [`src/index.js`](src/index.js) is not accidental — it encodes two real constraints:

```
              ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  incoming ──▶│ 1. /api/webhooks/clerk  (express.raw — BEFORE json)       │
  request     │ 2. express.json()        parse every other body           │
              │ 3. cors()                allow the SPA's origin(s)         │
              │ 4. clerkMiddleware()     attach session context to req    │
              │ 5. routes  (/health, /api/auth, …)                        │
              │ 6. central error handler                                  │
              └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why the webhook is mounted first, with `express.raw()`:** Clerk signs its webhooks and I verify that signature against the **exact raw bytes** of the request body. If `express.json()` parsed the body first, it would re-serialize it and the signature check would fail on a body that looks identical but isn't byte-for-byte the same. So the webhook route is mounted _before_ the JSON parser and reads a raw `Buffer`. This is the kind of subtle ordering bug that's painful to debug later, so it's the first thing the file does — with a comment explaining why.

---

## Authentication: Clerk as the identity source, Mongo as the local mirror

This is the pattern I'd most want to talk through in an interview, because it's a real distributed-systems problem in miniature: **two systems that both need to know about a user, kept in sync.**

- **Clerk owns identity.** Sign-up, login, OAuth, sessions, and tokens all live in Clerk. My server never sees a password.
- **My database owns app data.** A blog post needs an author; a comment needs a commenter; a chat message needs a sender and receiver. Those are foreign keys into _my_ `users` collection, not Clerk.

So every Clerk user needs a corresponding local `User` document. I keep them in sync **two ways**, which cover the two failure modes:

1. **Webhook (push, eventually-consistent):** Clerk POSTs to [`/api/webhooks/clerk`](src/webhooks/clerk.webhook.js) on `user.created` / `user.updated` / `user.deleted`. I verify the signature, then `upsert` the user into Mongo (or delete them). This keeps the mirror current without the client doing anything.
2. **Route guard (pull, strongly-consistent at request time):** [`protectRoute`](src/middleware/auth.middleware.js) reads the Clerk session from the `Authorization: Bearer` token (my SPA is cross-origin, so it sends a token, not just a cookie), resolves the Clerk `userId`, looks up the matching Mongo user, and hangs it on `req.user` for downstream handlers. If the webhook hasn't synced that user yet, it returns a clear `404 "not synced yet"` instead of a confusing crash.

`GET /api/auth/check` is the thin endpoint the front end calls on load to bootstrap its auth store (and, for chat, to get the Mongo `_id` its socket connection is keyed on).

**Authorization / admin gating** is defense-in-depth: the source of truth is the Clerk session claim (`public_metadata.role`), and I _also_ mirror the role onto the Mongo doc for convenient read-side checks. Roles come from Clerk and the webhook, **never from user input** — a client can't POST itself to admin.

---

## Real-time: why the server is an `http.Server`, not `app.listen()`

Socket.io needs to attach to the underlying HTTP server to handle the WebSocket upgrade handshake. So in [`src/lib/socket.js`](src/lib/socket.js) I create the server explicitly:

```js
const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server, { cors: { origin: CLIENT_URLS } });
```

`index.js` then calls `server.listen(...)` (the HTTP server), **not** `app.listen(...)` (Express's convenience wrapper) — so Express handles REST and Socket.io handles WebSockets over the same port and process.

Presence is tracked in an in-memory `userId → socketId` map. On connect I record the socket and broadcast the full online set; on disconnect I remove it and broadcast again. A `getReceiverSocketId()` helper looks up one recipient's socket by their Mongo `_id`, and `sendMessage` uses it to `io.to(receiverSocketId).emit("newMessage", newMessage)` — a message is delivered straight to the one open socket that needs it, not broadcast to everyone. If the recipient isn't currently connected, the emit is simply skipped; they'll see the message via the normal `GET /api/messages/:id` fetch next time they open the thread. (In-memory presence is the right trade-off for a single-instance hobby deploy; scaling to multiple instances would swap this for a Redis adapter — a change I've scoped but not needed yet.)

---

## The unified data model (reconciling two schemas into one)

The single most fiddly part of merging two projects was that they modeled _the same user_ differently:

|              | Blog reference | Chat reference | My unified schema                   |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Clerk key    | `clerkUserId`  | `clerkId`      | **`clerkId`**                       |
| Display name | —              | `fullName`     | `fullName`                          |
| Handle       | `username`     | —              | `username`                          |
| Avatar       | `img`          | `profilePic`   | **`img`** (canonical)               |
| Role         | —              | —              | **`role`** (added for admin gating) |
| Saved posts  | `savedPosts`   | —              | `savedPosts` (kept, harmless)       |

Rather than carry both conventions forward, I picked one canonical field name per concept ([`src/models/user.model.js`](src/models/user.model.js)) and map the other project's fields onto it during its port. Small decision, but it's the difference between a clean model and one that leaks two histories forever.

---

## The blog posts API (`/api/posts`)

This is the first real feature endpoint on top of the foundation, and it shows the whole stack working together: public reads, admin-gated writes, and a small piece of read-side analytics.

**The routes** ([`src/routes/post.route.js`](src/routes/post.route.js)):

| Method   | Path                | Auth              | What it does                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/api/posts`        | public            | List with filters (`cat`, `author`, `search`), `sort`, pagination |
| `GET`    | `/api/posts/:slug`  | public            | One post by slug; bumps its visit counter first                   |
| `POST`   | `/api/posts`        | **admin**         | Create a post (auto-slugged)                                      |
| `PATCH`  | `/api/posts/feature`| **admin**         | Toggle a post's "featured" flag                                   |
| `DELETE` | `/api/posts/:id`    | admin **or** owner| Delete a post                                                     |

A few decisions here are worth walking through:

- **Public read, gated write — enforced at the API, not the UI.** Anyone can read posts; only the owner account can create or feature one. The blog's "Write" button is hidden from non-admins on the front end, but hiding UI isn't security — so `protectRoute` + `requireAdmin` guard the write routes server-side. I verified this at runtime: anonymous `POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` all return `401` before touching the database.

- **Two-tier authorization.** `protectRoute` answers "are you signed in?" (resolves the Clerk session to a Mongo user on `req.user`); `requireAdmin` answers "are you allowed?" ([`src/lib/roles.js`](src/lib/roles.js) reads the role from the Clerk session claim, falling back to the webhook-mirrored role on the user doc). `deletePost` is the interesting middle case — it's not purely admin: an admin can delete any post, but a regular author is scoped to their own, which the query expresses directly (`findOneAndDelete({ _id, user: req.user._id })`) so ownership is enforced in the database round-trip, not a separate read-then-check.

- **Mass-assignment protection.** `createPost` whitelists `title`/`desc`/`category`/`content`/`img` and sets `user` from the authenticated session — it never spreads `req.body` into the model, so a crafted request can't set `isFeatured`, inflate `visit`, or forge authorship.

- **Slug generation.** Titles become URL-safe slugs; on collision I suffix `-2`, `-3`, … derived from the *base* slug (not the previous candidate, which would compound into `foo-2-3`). The `unique` index on `slug` is the real guard against a race between the check and the insert.

- **Visit counter as its own middleware.** `GET /:slug` runs [`increaseVisit`](src/middleware/increaseVisit.js) before the read — a single atomic `$inc` (no read-modify-write race) that keeps the read handler a clean lookup. That counter is what powers the **Popular** (all-time visits) and **Trending** (visits within the last 7 days) sorts. These were cut when the blog was briefly planned on Firebase (they'd have needed public writes); on Mongo they're free, so they're back.

- **Correct pagination under filters.** The list counts documents against the *same* query it fetched (the reference counted all posts, so `hasMore` was wrong the moment you filtered by category) and caps the client-supplied `limit` so no request can ask for an unbounded page.

- **No try/catch in the controllers.** Express 5 forwards a rejected async handler straight to the central error handler, so every controller stays a clean happy-path and errors get one consistent `{ message }` shape.

> Cover-image uploads (the `img` field) are wired via ImageKit (slice 5, `GET /api/posts/upload-auth`) — a post's `img` is just the path that upload returns, and the frontend upload widget consuming it now exists in the blog client.

---

## The blog comments API (`/api/comments`)

Comments reuse every pattern the posts API established — same `protectRoute`/`resolveRole` gating, same query-scoped ownership, same whitelist-not-spread hardening — which is really the point: once the auth and authorization primitives exist, a second feature endpoint is small.

**The routes** ([`src/routes/comment.route.js`](src/routes/comment.route.js)):

| Method   | Path                    | Auth              | What it does                          |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/api/comments/:postId`  | public            | List a post's comments, newest first   |
| `POST`   | `/api/comments/:postId`  | **signed-in**      | Add a comment (any authenticated user) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/comments/:id`      | admin **or** owner| Delete a comment                       |

Two things carry over directly from the posts API, and one thing is new:

- **Signed-in-to-write, not admin-to-write.** Unlike posts (admin-only create), *any* signed-in user can comment — `POST` sits behind `protectRoute` alone, no `requireAdmin`. Reading is still public. This is the same two-tier model (`protectRoute` = "who are you", a second gate = "are you allowed") applied with a different second gate for a different resource.

- **Whitelist, not spread.** `addComment` pulls only `desc` out of `req.body` and sets `user`/`post` itself from `req.user._id` and `req.params.postId`. The reference controller spread `req.body` into the new comment, which meant a crafted request could set `user` or `post` directly and forge authorship or attach a comment to the wrong thread — the same class of bug `createPost`'s whitelist already closes on the posts side.

- **Cascade deletes — the new piece this slice adds.** A comment references a post and a user; deleting either side without cleaning up its comments leaves orphaned rows the frontend would have to silently filter around forever. Two places now clean up after themselves:
  - [`deletePost`](src/controllers/post.controller.js) runs `Comment.deleteMany({ post: id })` after removing the post (both the admin and owner-scoped branches).
  - The Clerk webhook's `user.deleted` handler ([`src/webhooks/clerk.webhook.js`](src/webhooks/clerk.webhook.js)) — a `TODO` since slice 2, because `Post`/`Comment` didn't exist yet — now runs `Post.deleteMany` and `Comment.deleteMany` against the deleted user's Mongo `_id`, mirroring what the reference blog's webhook did in one step. Both cascades run *after* the parent record is confirmed deleted, and both are scoped by ID (`{ post: id }` / `{ user: id }`), so they can't touch unrelated documents.

---

## Blog media uploads (`GET /api/posts/upload-auth`)

Cover images upload **client-side, straight from the browser to ImageKit** — the file itself never passes through this server. What the server provides is a short-lived, signed authorization the browser presents to ImageKit's upload API.

- **The endpoint only signs; it never touches a file.** [`getUploadAuth`](src/controllers/post.controller.js) calls the ImageKit SDK's `helper.getAuthenticationParameters()`, which HMAC-signs a token + expiry (default 30 minutes) using the private key. It returns `{ token, expire, signature }` — enough for the browser to authenticate a direct upload, nothing more.
- **Admin-gated**, same as `createPost`/`featurePost` (`protectRoute` + `requireAdmin`): only the owner account can mint an upload authorization, since only the owner can create posts in the first place.
- **The private key never leaves the server** — it signs the params here and is never sent to the client; only the resulting `token`/`expire`/`signature` are.
- **The ImageKit client is built lazily, not at import time** ([`src/lib/imagekit.js`](src/lib/imagekit.js)). The `@imagekit/nodejs` SDK's constructor throws *synchronously* if `IK_PRIVATE_KEY` is missing — and this module is imported by `post.route.js` on every server boot, so building the client eagerly at the top of the file would have crashed `npm run dev` the instant ImageKit wasn't configured yet, exactly like every other slice built ahead of its third-party keys. Instead `getImageKitClient()` checks the env var first and only constructs (and caches) the client once it's present; `getUploadAuth` returns a clean `503 "Image upload is not configured yet"` if it's still missing, the same pattern the Clerk webhook already uses for its own missing signing secret.
- **`img` on `Post` stays a plain string** ([`src/models/post.model.js`](src/models/post.model.js)) — the create flow doesn't change; the frontend sends the path the direct upload hands back as one more field in the existing `createPost` whitelist.

---

## The chat messages API (`/api/messages`)

Chat reuses the identity layer wholesale (same `protectRoute`, same unified `User`) but everything about *what* it stores and *how it's delivered* is new — a message needs two participants instead of one author, has to arrive in real time instead of waiting for the next page load, and its media has to reach ImageKit through the server rather than straight from the browser.

**The routes** ([`src/routes/message.route.js`](src/routes/message.route.js)) — all behind `protectRoute`, no public reads (unlike the blog, chat is not content meant to be browsed signed-out):

| Method | Path                     | What it does                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/api/messages/users`    | Every other synced user, for the "start a new conversation" list     |
| `GET`  | `/api/messages/conversations` | Just the people you've already exchanged messages with, most-recent first |
| `GET`  | `/api/messages/:id`      | Full message history with one other user, oldest first               |
| `POST` | `/api/messages/send/:id` | Send text and/or one image/video to that user                        |

A few decisions worth walking through:

- **Conversations are derived, not stored.** There's no `Conversation` model — [`getConversationsForSidebar`](src/controllers/message.controller.js) runs a Mongo aggregation over `Message` itself: match every message where I'm the sender or receiver, group by "the other participant" (a `$cond` picking whichever side isn't me), keep the most recent timestamp per group, sort, then `$lookup` each group's `_id` back into a full `User` document. One collection stays the single source of truth instead of a second one I'd have to keep in sync with it.

- **Server-side upload, unlike the blog.** Cover images go straight from the browser to ImageKit (see [Blog media uploads](#blog-media-uploads-get-apipostsupload-auth) above); chat media goes through this server instead ([`upload.middleware.js`](src/middleware/upload.middleware.js) — Multer, in-memory storage, a 25 MB cap, and a `fileFilter` that rejects anything that isn't `image/*` or `video/*`). The reason for the different pattern: `sendMessage` has to know the resulting media URL *before* it can save the message and emit it over the socket, so the upload has to complete inside the same request that creates the message — there's no separate "upload, then reference the URL" step like the blog's editor has. `uploadChatMedia` ([`src/lib/imagekit.js`](src/lib/imagekit.js)) reuses the same lazily-built ImageKit client the blog's upload-auth endpoint uses, just calling `files.upload()` directly with the buffer instead of only signing params, into a separate `/chat` folder on the same ImageKit account.
- **Real-time delivery, not polling.** After saving, `sendMessage` looks up the receiver's live socket via `getReceiverSocketId()` and emits `newMessage` directly to it (see [Real-time](#real-time-why-the-server-is-an-httpserver-not-applisten) above) — if they have the app open, the message appears instantly; if not, it's just there next time they fetch the thread.
- **Whitelist by construction, not by filtering.** `sendMessage` builds the new `Message` from exactly four fields it derives itself (`senderId` from the session, `receiverId` from the URL param, `text` from the body, `image`/`video` from the upload result) — there's no `req.body` spread to whitelist *against* in the first place, so there's no mass-assignment surface to close.
- **Media is genuinely optional, on both ends.** A message can be text-only, media-only, or both — `text` is never required, and the frontend composer only appends it to the upload's `FormData` when there's actually a caption to send.

---

## Security & robustness choices worth calling out

- **Webhook signature verification** — the webhook trusts the payload _only_ after `verifyWebhook` passes; a bad or tampered signature returns `400` and touches nothing.
- **Strict CORS allowlist** — origins come from `CLIENT_URL` (comma-separated: local SPA in dev, my Vercel domain in prod) with `credentials: true`. No `*`.
- **Fail-fast on misconfig** — the DB connection [exits the process](src/lib/db.js) if `MONGO_URI` is missing or the connect fails, so a broken deploy dies loudly instead of serving half-broken.
- **Central error handler** — one place formats errors into consistent JSON (`{ message }`) and honors a handler-set status code, so controllers can just `throw`.
- **Nothing hardcoded** — every secret and every environment difference is an env var, documented in [`.env.example`](.env.example).
- **Health check** — `GET /health` for uptime monitoring and deploy readiness.

Concerns are split the conventional way — routes declare endpoints, middleware guards them, controllers hold logic, models define data, `lib` holds cross-cutting infrastructure — so each new feature slice drops into an obvious place.

## API surface (so far)

| Method   | Path                  | Auth               | Purpose                                    |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`    | `/health`             | —                  | Liveness/readiness probe                   |

## Running it locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js, a MongoDB Atlas connection string, and a Clerk application (publishable + secret keys, and a webhook signing secret).

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the values
npm run dev            # nodemon, restarts on save
```

`npm start` runs it without nodemon (what Render uses).

### Environment variables

| Var                                                    | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                                                 | Port to listen on (default `3000`)                        |
| `NODE_ENV`                                             | `development` / `production`                              |
| `CLIENT_URL`                                           | Comma-separated CORS allowlist (SPA in dev + prod domain) |
| `MONGO_URI`                                            | MongoDB Atlas connection string                           |
| `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` / `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`           | Clerk API keys                                            |
| `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`                         | Verifies inbound Clerk webhooks                           |
| `IK_URL_ENDPOINT` / `IK_PUBLIC_KEY` / `IK_PRIVATE_KEY` | ImageKit media — `IK_PRIVATE_KEY` signs `/api/posts/upload-auth` and never leaves this server; the frontend consumes the endpoint and public key directly via its own `VITE_IK_*` vars |

## Deploying (Render)

**Live at `https://3dfolio-ajfm88-server.onrender.com`.** Deployed via Render's manual **New → Web Service** flow (no Blueprint — Root Directory alone covers the monorepo split):

1. **Render → New → Web Service**, connect the `3dfolio` GitHub repo.
2. **Root Directory**: `server`. **Build Command**: `npm install`. **Start Command**: `npm start`. **Instance Type**: Free.
3. **Environment variables** — copy straight from local `server/.env`: `NODE_ENV=production`, `CLIENT_URL` (comma-separated: the Vercel origin(s) + `http://localhost:5173` for local frontend dev against the live API), `MONGO_URI`, `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `IK_URL_ENDPOINT`, `IK_PUBLIC_KEY`, `IK_PRIVATE_KEY`. Don't set `PORT` — Render injects its own and expects the app to bind to it. Leave `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` out for now, added in step 5.
4. **Health Check Path** (under Advanced): `/health`. Deploy, confirm `https://<service>.onrender.com/health` → `{ok:true}`.
5. **Clerk dashboard → Webhooks → Add endpoint** → `https://<service>.onrender.com/api/webhooks/clerk`, subscribe to `user.created` / `user.updated` / `user.deleted`. Copy the signing secret into Render's `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` (triggers a redeploy). Verified via Clerk's Testing tab — a sample `user.created` event delivered with a `200`.
6. **External keep-alive:** a FastCron job hits `/health` every 10 minutes so the free-tier instance doesn't spin down (Render free web services sleep after 15 min idle). Lives outside the repo by design — no in-app cron.
7. **Pre-deploy Clerk checklist — done:** `ale@ajfm88.com` has `{"role":"admin"}` set in Clerk public metadata, *and* Sessions → Customize session token includes `{ "metadata": "{{user.public_metadata}}" }` so `resolveRole` reads the role straight off the session claim rather than only the webhook-mirrored fallback. Verified end-to-end: sign in, create a post, delete a post — no 403s.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Slices 1–2 — Foundation:** server + DB + socket wiring, Clerk auth, user-sync webhook, unified User model.
- [x] **Slice 3 — Blog posts API:** Post model, `/api/posts` list/read/create/delete/feature, admin gating, visit-counter Popular/Trending sorts.
- [x] **Slice 4 — Blog comments API:** Comment model, `/api/comments` list/add/delete, signed-in-to-write gating, cascade-delete on both post delete and `user.deleted`.
- [x] **Slice 5 — ImageKit uploads:** admin-gated, lazily-built `GET /api/posts/upload-auth` returns signed client-upload params; private key never leaves the server.
- [x] **Slice 6 — Deploy:** live on Render, Clerk webhook registered and verified delivering, external FastCron keep-alive on `/health`. See [Deploying (Render)](#deploying-render) above.
- [x] **Chat Phase A:** Message model, `/api/messages` routes (users / conversations / history / send), server-side ImageKit upload via Multer, Socket.io delivery via `getReceiverSocketId`.

The backend is done, and both frontends that consume it are complete too: the blog (`src/blog/`, lazy `/blog`) — authoring, listing, filtering, reading, comments — and chat (`src/chat/`, lazy `/chat`) — sidebar, real-time messaging, media, presence, sounds, mobile. See `blog-plan.md` and `chat-plan.md` at the repo root for their trackers.

Built incrementally, one small slice per commit, on purpose — each step is reviewable on its own and the server is runnable at every commit.
